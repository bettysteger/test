      text1: The two methods of authentication are supported equally. If you wish to change your authentication details (username, email, password, token) you can do so on your account settings page.
      text2_html: '%{http} supports the use of several authentication mechanisms to
        control access to pages and other resources. These mechanisms are all based
        around the use of the 401 status code and the WWW-Authenticate response header.
        The client sends the username and password as unencrypted, base64-encoded
        text. Because it is unencrypted, it should only be used with %{https}, as
        the password can be easily captured and reused over HTTP.<br />Luckily, LingoHub
        encrypts all communication with %{ssl} (see %{http_authentication}).'

      text1_html: You need a GET request for any data retrieval method for the LingoHub API. A POST/PUT is required to submit, change, or destroy data methods. To destroy data a DELETE request is also acceptable. Unless you make a request using the correct HTTP method you will receive an error message where the API Method requires one. %{link} are meaningful.
      text2_html: 'With the exception of the Streaming API, the LingoHub API attempts
        to conform to the design principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
        Simply change the format extension of a request to get results in the format
        of your choice. The documentation notes which formats are available for each
        method. The API presently supports the following data formats: %{link} and
        %{link1}'
      text3_html: 'Some API methods take optional or requisite parameters. Two things
        to keep in mind when making requests with parameters:'
      text4_html: You need to convert parameter values to %{link} and be URL-encoded.<br />Page parameters begin at 1, rather than 0.
      text5: Numerous LingoHub API libraries have been created by our user community. Please let us know if you are aware of one that is not listed.
      text_html: To protect LingoHub from abuse the %{link} usage is rate-limited, with additional fair use limits.
