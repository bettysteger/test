      text1: Both of these authentication approaches are equally supported. You can change your authentication credentials (username, email, password, token) on your account settings page.
      text2_html: '%{http} supports the use of several authentication mechanisms to
        control access to pages and other resources. These mechanisms are all based
        around the use of the 401 status code and the WWW-Authenticate response header.
        The client sends the username and password as unencrypted, base64-encoded
        text. Because it is unencrypted, it should only be used with %{https}, as
        the password can be easily captured and reused over HTTP.<br />Luckily, Lingohub
        encrypts all communication with %{ssl} (see %{http_authentication}).'
      text3_html: Instead you may add the URL parameter <i>'auth_token'</i> to your request. The value of your personal token can be found on your 'Authentication' page.

      text1_html: Methods to retrieve data from the Lingohub API require a GET request. Methods that submit, change, or destroy data require a POST/PUT. A DELETE request is also accepted for methods that destroy data. API Methods that require a particular HTTP method will return an error if you do not make your request with the correct one. %{link} are meaningful.
      text2_html: 'With the exception of the Streaming API, the Lingohub API attempts
        to conform to the design principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).
        Simply change the format extension of a request to get results in the format
        of your choice. The documentation notes which formats are available for each
        method. The API presently supports the following data formats: %{link} and
        %{link1}'

        to keep in mind when making requests with parameters:'
      text4_html: Parameter values should be converted to %{link} and be URL-encoded.<br />The page parameter begins at 1, not 0.
      text5: The community has created numerous Lingohub API libraries. If you know of others we haven’t listed, let us know.
      text_html: The %{link} usage is rate-limited, with additional fair use limits to protect Lingohub from abuse.
      title: There are limits to how many calls and changes you can make per day.

          In our opinion, policemen should fight crime, race car drivers should drive cars, painters should paint - and translators should translate. Why bother with all the work processes of different customers, complicated technical issues and formats that change faster than the weather, billing and contracts? On Lingohub, you can concentrate on what you love and what you’re great at: translating.
          We believe <strong>translation is not a job, it’s a profession</strong>. We share your passion for language and nuance, and so we built an environment that is easy to use and takes all the technical problems off you hands. You can translate on a context-aware interface, use translation tools to support your work and get immediate feedback on your progress. It’s that easy.

        nordeus: We are amazed at how convenient our localization process has become with Lingohub, the integration and API make it a breeze to use. We have been able to practically eliminate translation overhead, improve the translation process and supporting immediate multilingual roll-out of our games has helped us reach more customers.
        runtastic: As one of the most popular fitness app vendos, Runtastic has customers all over the world who expect regular updates and an intuitive interface in their language. Runtastic has over 30 apps for all major platforms, in over 15 languages. Keeping overhead down in the localization process is of high importance. Lingohub integrates neatly into their product cycle and helps their team through ease of use and reliability.
        solvistas: User acceptance and efficiency are at the core of the enterprise business, so we needed a tool to complement our strategy of making our services available in the customer's language without delay, at minimal cost. Lingohub delivers a perfectly integrated localization management solution that exceeded our expectations.
        sourcefabric: At Sourcefabric, we believe the user interfaces of our software should be available in as many languages as possible.....So we began looking around for a new system that could be used to localize the software that we produce. We evaluated building our own system against the cloud services that are available, and the service that we liked the most was Lingohub. We've found it has the features that we need to work simultaneously and collaboratively on the .po resource files that our software uses.

      text1: With a full-featured online translation interface, translators don’t need to edit resource files. And neither do you. The localization process takes place in the browser.
      text2: A team of translators can work on your texts collaborating simultaneously, so you can launch faster. Invite as many collaborators as you need to localize your app on time.
      text3: Lingohub integrates into your existing environments, there is little adaptation required. You can use existing tools such as Github, or our CLI client.
      text4: Plenty of contextual information increases the quality of the text and decreases the need to communicate and clarify things. Add comments or screenshots to texts.
      text5: You always know the current progress and get notified of changes and comments, get regular reports about progress. That way, you manage the translation of your app, it doesn't manage you.
      text6: With all file handling out of the way, quickly deploy a multilingual app, export or sync the results. Get your application localized without headaches, save money and deliver high quality releases.
